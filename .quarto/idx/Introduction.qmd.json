Following major crackdowns on illegal fishing activities, suspects have shifted investments into more regulated sectors such as the ocean tourism industry, resulting in growing tensions. This increased tourism has recently attracted the likes of international pop star Sailor Shift, who announced plans to film a music video on the island.\n\nClepper Jensen, a former analyst at FishEye and now a seasoned journalist for the Hacklee Herald, has been keenly observing these rising tensions. Recently, he turned his attention towards the temporary closure of Nemo Reef. By listening to radio communications and utilizing his investigative tools, Clepper uncovered a complex web of expedited approvals and secretive logistics. These efforts revealed a story involving high-level Oceanus officials, Sailor Shift’s team, local influential families, and local conservationist group The Green Guardians, pointing towards a story of corruption and manipulation.\n\nOur task is to develop new and novel visualizations and visual analytics approaches to help Clepper get to the bottom of this story.\n\n### 1.1.2 Questions\n\nClepper diligently recorded all intercepted radio communications over the last two weeks. With the help of his intern, they have analyzed their content to identify important events and relationships between key players. The result is a knowledge graph describing the last two weeks on Oceanus. Clepper and his intern have spent a large amount of time generating this knowledge graph, and they would now like some assistance using it to answer the following 4 questions.\n\n> **Question 1**\n>\n> Clepper found that messages frequently came in at around the same time each day.\n>\n> 1a. Develop a graph-based visual analytics approach to identify any daily temporal patterns in communications.\n>\n> 1b. How do these patterns shift over the two weeks of observations?\n>\n> 1c.

We were asked to identify people, their roles, and the events and locations they talked to get to the bottom of the story. This graph is a network data that contains nodes that represent the different entities, events, and relationships, and edges which represent the relationships between different nodes.\n\n## **1.3 Methodology**\n\nTo answer these questions, we investigated the communications and relationships among entities.
